##### Autocomplete Exercise

You should implement an autocomplete component.

- Do not use any UI libraries such as Bootstrap/Material for the autocomplete logic/UI
- The UI shouldn't be fancy, but a nice-looking UI will be appreciated
- The component should be written using Angular
- Bonus - add meaningful unit tests for your work

To demonstrate it, you should write a minimal webserver in Go or Node.js that serves up the contents of world-cities.txt as required.

Please don't share this exercise or solution on any public profiles. Thanks!
